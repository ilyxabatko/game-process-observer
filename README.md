# Game Process Observer
This is an **eBPF-based Process Observer** that passively monitors a target process (PID you control) to collect different trace data, process it and build baselines and surface anomalies (e.g. unusual syscalls, unexpected library calls, suspicious ptrace attempts, etc).

## Goals
The main (current) goals of the project are:
 - gain knowledge about Linux OS, its kernel and eBPF programs;
 - gain knowledge about eBPF role in Linux game anti-cheats;
 - build a demo tracing tool to catch different kinds of anomalies that target a selected process;
